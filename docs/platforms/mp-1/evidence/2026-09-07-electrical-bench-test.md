# MP-1 Electrical Bench Test — 2026-09-07

**Status:** In progress

## Objective

Verify the Meadowlark Platform 1 (MP-1) electrical power architecture and establish baseline measurements before permanent wiring and propulsion testing.

## Safety Configuration

- Propeller removed for all initial electrical testing.
- High-current battery power connections use proper RC connectors/harnesses, not exposed alligator clips.
- Alligator clips may be used for low-current measurement connections only.
- Power is removed before changing wiring unless a specific energized measurement requires otherwise.

## Test Configuration

- Flight battery: Spektrum SPMX54S50H5 Smart G2 LiPo, 5000 mAh, 4S, 14.8 V nominal, 50C, IC5
- Battery state: Fully charged before test
- Charger used: Spektrum S2100 SPMXC1010, OS 1.1.0.17
- Flight controller: Holybro Pixhawk 6C Mini
- Power module: Holybro PM02 V3
- ESC: Hobbywing Skywalker 50A V2
- Motor: T-Motor F90 2806.5 1300KV
- Servos: EMAX ES3059MD digital metal gear, three planned for installation
- Multimeter: TESMEN TM-510

## Bench Measurements

| Test | Expected / Reference | Measured | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Battery voltage, unloaded | Approximately 16.8 V when fully charged | TBD | TBD | First measurement |
| Battery polarity | Correct | TBD | TBD | |
| PM02 V3 input voltage | Near battery voltage | TBD | TBD | |
| Pixhawk supply voltage | 5 V-class regulated supply | TBD | TBD | |
| ESC BEC output voltage | 5 V nominal | TBD | TBD | |
| Servo rail voltage, idle | Stable near BEC nominal | TBD | TBD | |
| Servo rail voltage, three servos moving | Stable near BEC nominal | TBD | TBD | |
| Pixhawk-reported battery voltage | Close to multimeter measurement | TBD | TBD | |

## Propulsion Measurements

Propeller remains removed until the propulsion-test stage explicitly authorizes installation.

| Throttle | Battery V | Current A | Motor Temp | ESC Temp | Result / Notes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 0% | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | |
| 25% | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | |
| 50% | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | |
| 75% | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | |
| 100% | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | |

## Observations / Exceptions

- TBD

## Test Completion

This record remains **In progress** until the applicable bench checks are completed and results are reviewed against the MP-1 test plan.
